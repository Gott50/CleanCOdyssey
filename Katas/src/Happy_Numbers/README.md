#[Function Kata “Happy Numbers”](http://ccd-school.de/en/coding-dojo/function-katas/happy-numbers/)

Write a function to determine whether a given number is “happy” or not.

A “[happy number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_number)” is a number where the sum of the squares of its digits “in the long run” is equal to 1. Example:

    19 -> 1^2 + 9^2 = 82 -> 8^2 + 2^2 = 68 -> 6^2 + 8^2 = 100 -> 1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 = 1

##Variations #1

Find all “happy numbers” within a range of numbers, e.g. from 10 to 20.
