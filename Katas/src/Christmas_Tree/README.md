#[Christmas tree](http://ccd-school.de/en/coding-dojo/function-katas/christmas-tree/)

Write a function that „draws“ a Christmas tree with ASCII characters (ASCII art). The „picture“should be returned as a collection of strings. See the following example of a tree with height 5:

    ChristmasTree.draw(5)
           X
          XXX
         XXXXX
        XXXXXXX
       XXXXXXXXX
           I

##Variation #1

The Christmas tree may have a star at the top:

    ChristmasTree.drawWithTop(5) or ChristmasTree.draw(5, true)
           *
           X
          XXX
         XXXXX
        XXXXXXX
       XXXXXXXXX
           I
